We are working with the Pokemon GO spawn rate dataset along with the police incidents report of SF Police Department (2012-2018). We will be joining the two datasets based on the lat-long of the data to possibly investigate trends on the spawn of what is considered to be a rare pokemon and the number of violent crimes committed in the area.
